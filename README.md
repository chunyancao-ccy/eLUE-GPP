# eLUE-GPP
A global gross primary productivity product based on ecosystem light-use-efficiency model and MODIS EVI
The eLUE Gross Primary Productivity (eLUE-GPP) is based on a simple yet ecologically sound ecosystem light use efficiency (eLUE) GPP model, using the more than two decades of global MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) product and the publicly available FLUXDATA2015 dataset, to generate a global GPP product (eLUE-GPP) from February 2000 to December 2024. The eLUE-GPP is available in both global and site scales and at various temporal and spatial resolutions.
